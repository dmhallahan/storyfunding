Each story is an opportunity to receive a donation. The stories are the pitch and the perk.\r\n\r\n### What's the difference between this and all the others?\r\n#### The focus is on story telling and using the stories as an asset to be exchanged for donations. \r\n\r\n#### Are people really going to share their stories publicly? \r\nMany people in need want to share their story for many reasons: it helps others in need; it highlights their problem in society; it can help them heal if they have been abused; it gives their life purpose to be a spokesperson for their cause, even in just a small way; people love to talk about themselves.\r\n\r\n#### Are people really going to pay for them? \r\nWell, it's a donation so typically you expect to get nothing. And often you choose to give nothing. The idea here is if we give you something then maybe you'll feel more inclined to give. It also plays on your emotions just like tv commericals and other media. The difference is the cost to record and distribute these stories is zero. \r\n\r\n#### Keep talking...\r\nTypical charity fund raising is done through expensive events like golf, galas, lotteries, etc. These require huge expense for equipment and personnel. Once you subtract these costs from the total donated your $50 donation is greatly reduced. This won't necessarily replace those type of events because they have their own uses but it provides a way providing a low cost perk to donors with hopefully some of the rewards of these other events: namely, a story to tell. \r\n\r\nOther online fund raising models are similar to this but don't use stories as a currency. The content is generally left to the creativity of the charity or media company. With storyfunding, the content generation is built in. The structure is there for charities to gather and publish stories. Story telling guidelines and approaches are provided to help make a story as persuasive and/or entertaining as possible. This is a low cost platform for charities directly as well as a tool for talented media companies to manage their online presence. \r\n\r\n#### Let's hear more details.\r\nThere is an online administration system as you would expect and everything runs in the cloud. Of course, the typical social media outlets are used to get the message out and the platform makes that easy. The difference is the content generation and broadcast system. There is a structure to collect the stories and craft them for effectiveness. There is a scheduling component for the broadcasts so that a campaign can be organized and programmed for a particular time and media focus. Once programmed, the broadcasts are automated so that follow ups, additional stories, etc. can arrive in a preset time frame.\r\n\r\nOther automated tools include handling thank you emails and follow ups to existing donors. Of course, analytics keep track of donors to provide insight for future campaigns.\r\n\r\n#### What's the typical work flow?\r\nThe basic steps are: \r\n1. Create an account for the charity.\r\n2. Setup all the usual stuff: descriptions, media, payment system (Paypal, etc).\r\n3. Add stories: write ups, photos and other media. \r\n4. Schedule the campaign: set times and media destinations for the stories. \r\n5. Start campaign: stories begin to appear across the web. \r\n6. Watch the donations come in. \r\n7. Iterate: add more stories, create new campaigns, analyze the results and repeat.\r\n\r\n#### Is there a demo?\r\nNo, this is all there is. I just wonder if it's a sufficiently different idea (or solves the proper problem) to pursue. You can let me know here [dmhallahan@hotmail.com](mailto:dmhallahan@hotmail.com?subject=storyfunding)"}
